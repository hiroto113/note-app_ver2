# Regression Test Suite

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive regression tests designed to prevent the reintroduction of previously fixed bugs and ensure system stability across releases.

## Test Architecture

## Test Categories

### 1. Critical Path Regression Tests

- Authentication flows
- Content management lifecycle
- Data integrity operations
- Security boundaries

### 2. Bug Prevention Tests

Based on historical bug patterns:

- Database migration failures
- Authentication session issues
- UI navigation problems
- Performance degradation

### 3. Integration Regression Tests

- API contract stability
- Database transaction consistency
- Service integration points
- External dependency interfaces

## Usage

### Running Regression Tests

```bash
# Run all regression tests
pnpm test tests/regression

# Run specific category
pnpm test tests/regression/core

# Run with coverage
pnpm test tests/regression --coverage

# Run in watch mode for development
pnpm test tests/regression --watch
```

### Test Data Management

Regression tests use the established test isolation patterns:

```typescript
import { testIsolation } from '../integration/utils/test-isolation';
import { RegressionTestBase } from './utils/regression-test-base';

class MyRegressionTest extends RegressionTestBase {
	async setupTestData() {
		return await testIsolation.setupBasicTestData();
	}
}
```

## Test Guidelines

### 1. Test Independence

- Each test must be completely isolated
- No dependencies on test execution order
- Clean state before and after each test

### 2. Historical Bug Coverage

- Every significant bug fix should have a corresponding regression test
- Tests should validate the specific conditions that caused the original bug
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

### 3. Performance Considerations

- Regression tests should complete in under 5 minutes total
- Use efficient data setup and teardown
- Avoid unnecessary database operations

### 4. Maintainability

- Clear test descriptions explaining what regression is being prevented
- Reference original bug reports or issues when applicable
- Regular review and updates as system evolves

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Coverage Targets

- Core functionality: 95% regression coverage
- API contracts: 100% regression coverage
- Critical user journeys: 90% regression coverage

### Performance Targets

- Full suite execution: < 5 minutes
- Individual test execution: < 30 seconds
- False positive rate: < 1%

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks

Critical regression tests run automatically before commits.

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

- Pull requests: High-priority regression tests
- Merge to main: Full regression test suite
- Nightly builds: Extended regression suite with performance tests

## Historical Context

This regression test suite was implemented to address patterns identified in the project's bug history, including:

- Database migration failures
- Authentication security issues
- UI accessibility problems
- Test infrastructure reliability
- CI/CD pipeline stability

## Maintenance

### Adding New Regression Tests

1. Identify the root cause of the bug
2. Create a test that would have caught the bug
3. Verify the test fails on the buggy code
4. Confirm the test passes on the fixed code
5. Add documentation linking to the original issue

### Updating Existing Tests

- Review regression tests quarterly
- Update tests when system architecture changes
- Remove obsolete tests for deprecated features
- Maintain test performance and reliability
