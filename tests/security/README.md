- **authentication-security.test.ts**: Tests authentication mechanisms including:
    - Session management security
    - Password security requirements
    - Brute force protection
    - Account lockout mechanisms
    - Authorization security (RBAC)

### 2. Injection Prevention (`injection/`)

- **injection-prevention.test.ts**: Tests prevention of injection attacks:
    - SQL injection prevention
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
    - Command injection prevention
    - Template injection prevention
    - Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Data Protection (`data-protection/`)

- **data-security.test.ts**: Tests data protection mechanisms:
    - Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
    - Personal data protection (GDPR compliance)
    - API keys and secrets management
    - Data anonymization and pseudonymization

### 4. Network Security (`network/`)

- **network-security.test.ts**: Tests network-level security:
    - HTTPS enforcement and TLS configuration
    - Security headers validation
    - CORS configuration
    - Rate limiting and DDoS protection
    - Request validation and filtering

### 5. Security Utilities (`utils/`)

- **security-test-helpers.ts**: Common utilities for security testing:
    - Attack payload generation
    - Security validation helpers
    - Test data management
    - Vulnerability simulation

- Share security best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Failures**: Check security configuration changes
2. **Performance Issues**: Review test data size and complexity
3. **False Positives**: Validate attack payload accuracy
4. **Coverage Gaps**: Review threat model completeness
